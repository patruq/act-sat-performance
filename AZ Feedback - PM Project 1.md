# Project 1 Feedback
This document breaks down your project feedback by criteria theme using the outline and scoring system in the project rubric (reproduced below for reference).

Please don't hesitate to let me know if you have any questions or concerns and I'm always happy to talk in more detail any time. Unless specifically stated, the feedback here is just meant for you to improve this presentation for your portfolio or for future presentations. If anything requires revision in order to receive credit for project, I will make that clear and reach out to you to discuss further.


## Scoring by Criteria Bucket
|Criteria |Score| Comments |
|---|---|---|
|Project Organization| 3 | Great organization with clear and detailed readme file on main page, good folder organization. I might add a small summary of the project at the top of the readme, but otherwise it's portfolio ready for visitors.
|Clarity of Message|1 | Question stated at top of the presentation. You note strong correlation between participation and scores, but it's importantly a *negative* correlation. At times, point you are making doesn't seem aimed at the questoin (it actually answers a bigger one!). I would just look to narrow this in for subsequent projects to make sure you are orienting around a single message.
|Python Syntax and Control Flow| 2 | Add comments to explain code, especially for defined functions. Good use of Pandas tools and calculation tools to get answers to statistical questions.
|Data Cleaning and EDA|2 | Good finding and correcting error; can tell examined data in a lot of ways. Good citing of helpful resources. Missing a few interpretations of later visuals.
|Visualizations|1 | Should generally avoid heatmaps for a non-technical audience. Could have used more visualizations to illustrate points on tradeoffs. Ones in there were not formatted to be easily read within presentation.
|Research and Conceptual Understanding|2|Good outside research brought in and used to call out key cases (with stats included).
|Presentation|2 | Nice design and use of formatting to call out key points. A bit rushed delivery (sounded like nerves) and a bit jumpy.

## Additional Comments
Generally a great job on this first project! Most of the notes above are more about making sure you allow yourself to take time and make sure you are setting up a clear story with visuals to match. Otherwise it just looks like shaking off the rust of doing these sort of presentations, especially when you've had your head in code! Based on this strong start, I look forward to seeing your Ames work!


## Rubric (Taken from main project page as reminder)
Your local instructor will evaluate your project (for the most part) using the following criteria.  You should make sure that you consider and/or follow most if not all of the considerations/recommendations outlined below **while** working through your project.

**Scores will be out of 21 points based on the 7 items in the rubric.** <br>
*3 points per section*<br>

| Score | Interpretation |
| --- | --- |
| **0** | *Project fails to meet the minimum requirements for this item.* |
| **1** | *Project meets the minimum requirements for this item, but falls significantly short of portfolio-ready expectations.* |
| **2** | *Project exceeds the minimum requirements for this item, but falls short of portfolio-ready expectations.* |
| **3** | *Project meets or exceeds portfolio-ready expectations; demonstrates a thorough understanding of every outlined consideration.* |

**Project Organization**
- Are modules imported correctly (using appropriate aliases)?
- Are data imported/saved using relative paths?
- Does the README provide a good executive summary of the project?
- Is markdown formatting used appropriately to structure notebooks?
- Are there an appropriate amount of comments to support the code?
- Are files & directories organized correctly?
- Are there unnecessary files included?
- Do files and directories have well-structured, appropriate, consistent names?

**Clarity of Message**
- Is the problem statement clearly presented?
- Does a strong narrative run through the project?
- Does the student provide appropriate context to connect individual steps back to the overall project?
- Is it clear how the final recommendations were reached?
- Are the conclusions/recommendations clearly stated?

**Python Syntax and Control Flow**
- Is care taken to write human readable code?
- Is the code syntactically correct (no runtime errors)?
- Does the code generate desired results (logically correct)?
- Does the code follows general best practices and style guidelines?
- Are Pandas functions used appropriately?
- Does the student demonstrate mastery masking in Pandas?
- Does the student demonstrate mastery sorting in Pandas?

**Data Cleaning and EDA**
- Does the student fix data entry issues?
- Are data appropriately labeled?
- Are data appropriately typed?
- Are datasets combined correctly?
- Are appropriate summary statistics provided?
- Are steps taken during data cleaning and EDA framed appropriately?

**Visualizations**
- Are the requested visualizations provided?
- Do plots accurately demonstrate valid relationships?
- Are plots labeled properly?
- Plots interpreted appropriately?
- Are plots formatted and scaled appropriately for inclusion in a notebook-based technical report?

**Research and Conceptual Understanding**
- Were useful insights gathered from outside sources?
- Are sources clearly identified?
- Does the student provide appropriate interpretation with regards to descriptive and inferential statistics?

**Presentation**
- Is the problem statement clearly presented?
- Does a strong narrative run through the presentation building toward a final conclusion?
- Are the conclusions/recommendations clearly stated?
- Is the level of technicality appropriate for the intended audience?
- Is the student substantially over or under time?
- Does the student appropriately pace their presentation?
- Does the student deliver their message with clarity and volume?
- Are appropriate visualizations generated for the intended audience?
- Are visualizations necessary and useful for supporting conclusions/explaining findings?

In order to pass the project, students must earn a minimum score of 1 for each category.
- Earning below a 1 in one or more of the above categories would result in a failing project.
- While a minimum of 1 in each category is the required threshold for graduation, students should aim to earn at least an average of 1.5 across each category. An average score below 1.5, while it may be passing, means students may want to solicit specific feedback in order to significantly improve the project before showcasing it as part of a portfolio or the job search.

### REMEMBER:

This is a learning environment and you are encouraged to try new things, even if they don't work out as well as you planned! While this rubric outlines what we look for in a _good_ project, it is up to you to go above and beyond to create a _great_ project. **Learn from your failures and you'll be prepared to succeed in the workforce**.
